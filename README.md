# DIY CPU Simplified

A version of [DIY CPU](https://github.com/skagra/diy-cpu-meta) simplified to reduce the chip count and bus line count such that it is more straightforward to
implement physically on protoboard.

The repository contains:

* Designs and emulations of the [CPU using generic components](digital/generic/CPU.dig).
* Realizations and emulations of the [CPU using the `74HC` series of ICs](digital/74x/CPU.dig).
* [Î¼code](ucode) implementing a subset of the 6502 instruction set which runs on both the emulated CPU and the physical CPU.
* Hardware designs.
